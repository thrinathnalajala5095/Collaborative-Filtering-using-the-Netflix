# Collaborative-Filtering-using-the-Netflix

These days whether you look at a video on YouTube, a movie on Netflix or a product on Amazon, you are going to get recommendations for more things to view, like or buy. You can thank the advent of machine learning algorithms and recommender systems for this development. 
Recommender systems are far-reaching in scope, so we are going to zero in on an important approach called collaborative filtering, which filters information by using the interactions and data collected by the system from other users. It is based on the idea that people who agreed in their evaluation of certain items are likely to agree again in the future.
